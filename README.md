# Platform Ticket Recreation

![Platform Ticket Reference Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/greypse/image/upload/v1645646082/platform--ticket_vdpuyy.png)

The ticket above is for an event in 1895 to celebrate Elizabeth Cady Stanton's 80th birthday. I replicated this old ticket, which was created using a letterpress at the time, with modern web development best practices - HTML and CSS. 

As there are no images or color on this ticket, emphasis and contrast come from the different fonts for each line on the ticket. The challenge is finding typfaces like these on the internet today and manipulating them so that I can best replicate the ticket.

Inspiration for how to organize the development of this ticket came from Olivia Ng's [Hogwarts Ticket](https://codepen.io/oliviale/pen/MZZYyO)
